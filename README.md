<p align="center">Bible Memorized is an app that allows users to keep track of Bible Verses they would like to memorize or reference. The user is able to store Bible Verses into Collection categories for easy reference.

User Example:
As a parent who is always on the go I have a hard time finding quiet time at home to study and memorize verses.
I want an application that I can take on the go and use while waiting in carpool lines, waiting in doctor offices, or during childrenâ€™s soccer practice.
So that I can use what spare time do have to memorize verses and am able to have access to my personal list.
